## Project Details
An interactive web app which enables users to perform **contactless interactions** with the interface using simple human gestures. ‚ú®

> **Background**: The *COVID-19 pandemic* <img src="https://github.com/google/mediapipe/assets/48355572/8c2b1254-5323-4742-b0ec-f4a7c2232dfd" width="14.5px" height="15.5px"> has increased awareness of hygiene risks associated with touchscreens, with reports indicating that **80%** of people find them *unhygienic*. **Touchless** *gesture-based* intuitive systems can reduce transmission in public settings and workplaces, and offer a seamless and convenient experience. Touchless technology is expected to remain popular in various industries, such as retail, healthcare, and hospitality. 

The web app highlights a special **ATM** which showcases an <ins>augmented transaction panel, enabling users to interact accurately through intuitive gestures detected from an input video feed</ins>. Users can perform essential operations directly through the interactive floating panel (on screen) via custom simple-to-use gestures, allowing them to experience the checkout process without the need for physical touch. <br/>



<details><summary><b>Shortened Version <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48355572/234978665-08b7d16e-dace-479a-a061-478972c43f6b.gif" width="14px" height="14px"></b></summary><br/>In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified concerns regarding hygiene and touch-based interactions. With **80%** of individuals deeming public touchscreens *unhygienic*, there is a compelling need for innovative solutions. Enter touchless gesture-based systems, poised to reshape industries and public spaces. Seamlessly aligning with the post-pandemic era, this technology offers intuitive and convenient interactions. From **ATMs** and airports to healthcare and retail, touchless interactions are on the brink of becoming ubiquitous. This project directly addresses these changing expectations by harnessing the power of the MediaPipe <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/api/solutions/js/tasks-vision.handlandmarker">Hand Landmarker</a>
 task from MediaPipe Solutions. By precisely detecting <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker#models">21</a>
 key hand landmarks, this technology powers an interactive web application enabling users to effortlessly engage with interfaces through contactless gestures. Designed for optimal performance in well-lit environments and on larger screens, this project embodies the future of safer, more advanced interactions.</details>

## Project Report

Google‚Äôs [MediaPipe Solutions](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/guide) helps developers add machine learning to their end-user devices, including mobile, web, and IoT. It provides a framework that lets you configure prebuilt processing pipelines that deliver immediate, engaging, and useful output to users.

The demo showcases the capabilities of the MediaPipe [Hand Landmarker](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/api/solutions/js/tasks-vision.handlandmarker) task, which accurately detects and tracks [21](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker#models) hand landmarks. These landmarks are utilized in the **web app** to enable users to perform contactless interactions with the interface using simple gestures.
